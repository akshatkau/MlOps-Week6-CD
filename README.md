# MLOps Week 6 - Continuous Deployment

This project implements Continuous Deployment for the Iris FastAPI app using Docker, GitHub Actions, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The CI workflow builds and tests the Docker image, while the CD workflow pushes it to Google Artifact Registry and deploys it to GKE.

Both CI and CD workflows executed successfully, deploying the Iris model API to GKE.
